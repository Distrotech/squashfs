CVS status (devel-3_4):

This is the branch for the soon to be released Squashfs 3.4.  This
is basically HEAD just before the 4.0 changes started to be applied,
with some bug fixes that have come to light since then.

It wasn't my intention to do a 3.4 release but to go straight to
4.0, but the 3.3 release has too many patches missing for new
kernels (2.6.25, 2.6.26, 2.6.27-rcX) and too many rare but nasty
bugs have come to light to wait for 4.0...
