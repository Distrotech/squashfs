Squashfs is now targetted at linux-next from git.kernel.org.  These files will
not compile on anything older.

For earlier kernel versions please check if there's any patches in this
directory.  If a patch exists it will patch the squashfs code to work on that
kernel.

Using these files:

1. Patch your vanilla kernel (if not already patched by a distro) with the
   latest Squashfs release (currently 3.3).  This will provide the
   Kconfig/Makefiles etc.  which are not in CVS.  Use the kernel patch
   closest to your kernel (it doesn't really matter, you'll be replacing the
   important files anyway).

2. Copy the files in the CVS kernel tree to the appropriate places in the
   kernel source.

3. If you're using the linux-next tree then you're finished, just compile it.

4. Otherwise find the appropriate patch file for your kernel (in this
   directory), and patch your kernel source cd'ed into the top level
   directory (patch -p1 < xxx).  Next compile.
